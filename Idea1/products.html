        <div class="cd-faq-content">
          <p>It is a dietary supplement in capsule form. It provides nutritional support for detoxification and immune function, and supplies nutrients shown to be especially supportive for liver function and brain function. L-glutathione (GSH), N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) , and grape seed extract are the three antioxidants used, each powerful on its own; together they affect a host of critical cellular processes including oxidation and reduction reactions, detoxification reactions, and immune function. Their actions are involved in glutathione production, scavenging of potentially harmful reactive free radicals. It provides a skin whitening benefits on long term use.</p>

          <p>Gluthea Complex DR is formulated using the latest scientific research and state of the art technology to improve absorption of  L-glutathione (GSH), N-acetyl Cysteine (NAC) and its other active materials and deliver the most possible benefits. It is one of the ultimate technologies for delivering sensitive ingredients into the blood stream via the oral route.</p>

          <p>It is safer and No messy injection routine as compared to IV (intra-venous injection)and IM(intra muscular) Glutathione injection.It is guaranteed to disintegrate in the body at the right time and at the right place.</p>

        <a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What is Delayed Release?</a>
        <div class="cd-faq-content">
          <p>It means that the active ingredients are not released in the acidic stomach environment, rather on a more alkaline space (the upper intestine) therefore absorption is higher. Having a technologically advanced capsule, it protects the ingredients from gastric juices and enzymes. Once the capsule detects a more alkaline environment, it is only then that the ingredients are released.</p> 

          <p>Some experts believe that due to the damage done by the acidic nature of the stomach, only 10-15% are actually absorbed. With Delayed Release Technology, at least 50% are absorbed by the body.</p>

        <div class="cd-faq-content">
          <p>The capsule has an acid resistant coating that protects the ingredients. It remains intact until it reaches a more alkaline area where it breaks down. This makes the body absorb the ingredients on a higher rate.</p>

          <p>It is the stable form of the amino acid cysteine. <strong>It is a precursor of glutathione and increases glutathione availability. It donates the amino acid cysteine to help form the antioxidant glutathione. </strong></p>
          <p><strong>N-acetyl-L-cysteine</strong> is a precursor in the body to the critical antioxidant glutathione, which is produced within cells, particularly by the liver. N-acetyl L-cysteine is an excellent source of sulfhydryl groups, and is converted in the body into metabolites capable of stimulating glutathione synthesis, promoting detoxification, and acting directly as a free radical scavenger. It provides many of the same benefits as GSH, both through its own detoxifying and antioxidant function.NAC can help the liver to detoxify pollutants such as cigarette smoke, auto exhaust, agricultural chemicals, cyanide, and toxic metals such as mercury, arsenic, chromium and lead, and can potentially help control the toxicity of some chemotherapy treatments.Studies suggest NAC may support respiratory function through its activity on viscous mucus.NAC is involved with the regulation of homocysteine levels.</p>

          <p>Rich in flavonoids, these phytochemicals have antioxidant properties.. The anti-oxidative activities of grape seed extracts are found to be much stronger than vitamin C and vitamin E and may involve radical scavenging, quenching, and enzyme-inhibiting actions. The most valuable flavonoids in grape seed extract are procyanidolic oligomers (also known as proanthocyanidins). Beyond their antioxidant powers, proanthocyanidins may also help atherosclerosis, gastric ulcer, large bowel cancer, cataracts and diabetes. Grape seed extract is effective in reducing the hyperpigmentation of women with chloasma. </p>

        <div class="cd-faq-content">
          <p>Oral bioavailability measures the amount of a nutrients/drug that actually gets into circulation within the body after being ingested</p>
          <p>Not every nutrient you swallow is absorbed by your body.  </p>
          <p><strong>The bioavailability of nutritional supplements is an often overlooked factor when comparing supplement brands. It has major implications for the efficacy and particularly value for money of a supplement.  </strong></p>
          <p><strong>Bioavailability</strong> basically means “the proportion of a nutrient or bioactive ingredient that was absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract” (1) for use or storage in the body. </p>

      <li>
        <a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Are The Ingredients  In A Dietary Supplement Fully Absorbed?</a>
        <div class="cd-faq-content">
          <p>For a dietary supplement ingredient to be absorbed it must pass through the intestinal wall lining and enter the bloodstream. Then find its way to target organs and body systems where it's put to use.</p>
          <p>Under the US Dietary and Health Education Act 1994 (DSHEA) nutritional supplements are regulated under ‘food’ GMP – this means absorption rates do not have to be tested – <strong>this has played a part in creating a credibility problem for the supplement industry.</strong></p>
          <p>The following factors all influence the total absorption of a supplement. But the most important one is in bold below.</p>
          <ul class="mb20">
            <li>disintegration time</li>
            <li>dissolution percentage</li>
            <li>excipients used</li>
            <li>nutrient forms</li>
            <li>presence of co-factors or inhibitors in the formula</li>
            <li>interactions with drugs</li>
            <li>time of the day taken</li>
            <li>area in the body where disintegration occurs (delivery system)</li>
            <li>absorption at the intestine and cellular level</li>
            <li>your body’s nutritional needs</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The most important thing to look for when shopping for vitamins is not price, which absolutely must take a secondary position to (1) bioavailability, (2) accuracy in the amounts of ingredients stated on the label, and (3) age and quality of the ingredients.</p>
          <p>The most crucial aspect to consider when evaluating any supplement is its bioavailability (which is synonymous to  absorption).</p>
          <p>Most supplements are  manufactured to a price standard rather than a best science standard, and bioavailability is left in the hit or miss section.And the result is that the active ingredients, released into the stomach, are attacked by stomach acids and mostly destroyed.</p>
          <p>High quality supplements are formulated to allow much <strong>higher levels of bioavailability</strong> than cheaper, mass produced vitamin and mineral products. This is because they are science based and use more sophisticated manufacturing processes. This is one reason why they cost more (but work better!).</p>

      <li>
        <a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">How does it work to deliver all those expensive nutrients into your body?</a>
        <div class="cd-faq-content">
          <p>The delivery system allows capsules to pass through the stomach intact, without being damaged by stomach acids. This is crucial because exposure to stomach acids can cause some of the most important nutrients, such as L-Glutathione, Resveratrol and SAMe, to be converted to various salt forms and to lose most of their potency, as well as potentially becoming inactive (and, therefore, of no use to your body).</p>
          <p>When the products reach the upper intestine, the special CAPSULE disintegrates and releases the active ingredients for passage through the intestinal membrane into the blood stream. The CAPSULE , which is inert, then continues on through the digestive system and is passed from the body.</p>
          <p>The special CAPSULES is made up of  polymers which are non-reactive and are not absorbed by the body nor affect it in any way. These polymers are pH sensitive meaning they will not react to the more acidic ph levels in the stomach but will react and disintegrate in the alkaline environment in the small intestine.</p>
          <p>How can manufacturers be sure that the special coating does what it’s supposed to do? By using tests which involve placing sample capsules in simulated gastric juices (SGF) and in simulated intestinal fluid (SIF).These are the  methods we will use which is  in conformance to protocols of the British and US pharmacopeia.</p>
